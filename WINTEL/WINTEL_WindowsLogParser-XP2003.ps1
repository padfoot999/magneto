#          Note that this is only for Windows 7 onwards. XP uses a different set of event IDs

.SYNOPSIS
This is a simple Powershell script to explain how to create help
REMEMBER TO "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned" using an administrative powershell console!!!


.DESCRIPTION
The script will parse all evtx logs in the directory passed to it as an argument.
It will extract all suspicious event IDs that may be helpful to the incident responder in resolving an incident.

.EXAMPLE
Process native logs on host machine.
./WindowsLogParser.ps1

Split parsed output. Note that you will have only 1 merged output.
./WindowsLogParser.ps1 d:\HOSTXYZ-WorkingCopy

Split parsed output by month. Note that you will have 2 copies of the same output - Merged, Month
./WindowsLogParser.ps1 d:\HOSTXYZ-WorkingCopy -month

Split parsed output by year. Note that you will have 2 copies of the same output - Merged, Year
./WindowsLogParser.ps1 d:\HOSTXYZ-WorkingCopy -year

Split parsed output by month AND year. Note that you will have 3 copies of the same output - Merged, Year, Month
./WindowsLogParser.ps1 d:\HOSTXYZ-WorkingCopy -year -month

#Following artifacts should be extracted to identify what happened
# 1 ) Event Info - (Event ID, Category, Description)
# 1 ) Date/Time - Provide a temporal picture of what happened (Timestamp)
# 2 ) Users Involved - User Attribution (User Account, Description)
# 3 ) Systems Involved - In a networked environment, we will very commonly find references to systems other than the
# host as resources are accessed remotely. Originally, only the Netbios name was recorded, making tracking and
# attribution much more difficult. In systems post-Windows 2000, IP addresses are now recorded within the event
# logs (when applicable). (Hostname, IP Address)
# 4 ) Resources Accessed - With nearly every resource considered an object, this provides very powerful
# auditing. E.g this can help identify attempted access to unauthorized files on a system. (Files, Folders, Printers, Services)
